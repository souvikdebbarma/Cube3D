This C program creates a cool animation of rotating 3D cubes right in your terminal using ASCII characters. Here's what it's doing:

The program starts by loading up some standard libraries for math, input/output, and strings. It also includes a special bit for Windows to handle delays since the default sleep function works differently on Windows compared to other systems.

It defines several global variables to track the rotation angles of the cubes (A, B, C), the size of the cubes, the dimensions of the screen, a buffer to store depth information, another buffer for the characters to be displayed, and the distance from the camera to the cubes.

To figure out where the points of the cube should go after rotating, it has three functions: calculateX, calculateY, and calculateZ. These use trigonometric functions like sine and cosine to do the rotations.

The calculateForSurface function takes these 3D points and converts them to 2D coordinates for the screen. It also checks how close each point is to the camera to handle which points should be visible and updates the display buffer with the right characters.

In the main function, there's an infinite loop that keeps the animation going. Every time through the loop, it clears the screen and resets the buffers. It then calculates and draws three cubes of different sizes and positions. After updating the buffers, it prints out the new frame to the screen.

The program uses special codes to clear the terminal screen and move the cursor back to the top left for each new frame. It slightly changes the rotation angles each time through the loop to animate the rotation and includes a short delay to control the speed of the animation.

So, in a nutshell, this program is all about taking some basic 3D graphics ideas and making them work in a text-based terminal. It's projecting 3D points to 2D, handling which surfaces should be visible, and creating a smooth rotating effect by continuously updating the rotation angles.
